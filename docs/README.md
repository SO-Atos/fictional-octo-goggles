# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation! This central hub provides comprehensive guidance on our project management processes, workflows, roles, and best practices.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes customer value, psychological safety, and data-informed decisions. Our process is designed to help cross-functional teams deliver high-quality product features, services, and integrations efficiently and effectively.

### Core Principles

- **Customer-first**: We prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: We deliver small, testable increments to enable faster feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has designated Project Managers and Product Leads
- **Data-informed decisions**: We measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: We encourage open feedback and continuous learning

### Key Roles

Our project teams typically include:
- **Project Managers (PM)**: Coordinate delivery, schedules, risk, and communications
- **Product Managers (PdM)**: Define outcomes, prioritize backlog, and measure success
- **Developers**: Implement features and collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs and approvals

For detailed role descriptions, see [Roles & Personas](./octoacme-roles-and-personas.md).

### Project Lifecycle

Our project lifecycle consists of five main phases:
1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, identify stakeholders, establish high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Scope work, allocate resources, set milestones, identify dependencies
3. **Execution & Tracking**: Build, test, review, and iterate with regular checkpoints
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy to production, verify functionality, communicate to stakeholders
5. **Retrospective**: Capture learnings, document improvements, and plan next steps

## Key Workflows

### Communication Cadence
- **Weekly syncs**: PM + PdM alignment meetings
- **Standups**: Twice-weekly (or as agreed) for delivery teams
- **Monthly updates**: Stakeholder briefings and progress reports
- **Ad-hoc escalations**: As needed for urgent issues

### Quality Assurance
- Unit tests for new logic
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end smoke tests for critical flows before release
- Security scanning integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Manual QA for feature acceptance when needed

### Pull Request Workflow
- Keep PRs small (â‰¤ 400 lines when possible)
- Include issue links and acceptance criteria in PR descriptions
- Run automated tests and linting before requesting review
- Require at least one approval before merging

### Risk Management
We maintain a Risk Register that tracks:
- Risk ID and description
- Impact and likelihood assessments
- Owner and mitigation plans
- Current status and monitoring

## Quick Reference

### Key Artifacts
- **Project Charter / One-pager**: Problem statement, goals, and success metrics
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: Timeline and milestone mapping
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized work items with acceptance criteria
- **Definition of Done**: Quality standards for completed work
- **Risk Register**: Tracked risks and mitigation strategies
- **Retrospective Notes**: Learnings and action items

### Communication Templates
- **Weekly Status**: Progress, next steps, risks, and decisions needed
- **Incident Communication**: Triage summary, actions, timeline, and post-incident review
- **Release Notes**: Version, date, summary, notable changes, and migration steps
